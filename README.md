Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values by dropping the Sample ID column and filling numerical values using the mean.
Encoded gender into numerical values and normalized the features for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Plotted distributions of features and used a correlation heatmap to check relationships between variables and detect multicollinearity.

Model Building:

Trained four models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,  Random Forest classifiers and XG Boost Classifier.
Data was split into 70% training and 30% testing.

Model Evaluation:

Random Forest performed the best with 90% accuracy and an AUC of 0.91, making it the most suitable model for predicting gender

Challenges:

Handled missing values, slight data imbalance, and feature multicollinearity effectively.
Random Forest  and XG Boost model proved to be the most robust model.

Based on the cross-validation scores you obtained for each model:

- Logistic Regression: 0.58
- Decision Tree :  0.82
- Random Forest : 0.88
- XGBoost : 0.89

# Observations:
1. Logistic Regression has the lowest score (0.58), indicating it might not be the best model for this task. It may be too simple or not capturing the complexity of the dental metrics well enough.
2. Decision Tree shows a decent performance (0.82) but may be prone to overfitting if not carefully tuned (for example, controlling tree depth and minimum samples per leaf).
3. Random Forest (0.88) and XGBoost (0.89) both have high scores and seem to perform well. These models usually generalize better due to their ensemble nature and built-in mechanisms to reduce overfitting.

# Conclusion:
- Random Forest and XGBoost perform the best in terms of cross-validation, indicating they are likely the most suitable models for your dataset.
- Decision Tree performs well but might need some further tuning.
- Logistic Regression appears to underperform compared to the others, likely due to the complexity of the data.
